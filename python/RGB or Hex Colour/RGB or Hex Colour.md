RGB is a color model that defines color by the combination of Red, Green, and Blue. An RGB tuple is composed of three numbers that specify the intensity of each color. Because it uses 8 bits (0s or 1s) for each color, each intensity can be transformed into a hexadecimal number with two digits at most.

There are 256 possible shades for each color, since "11111111" (or hex "ff") corresponds to decimal 255, plus the number 000. The combination of all 256 possible shades for the three primary colors gives 256 cubed, or over 16 million possible colors.

Write a function that takes a color in RGB or hex and returns the opposite. If it takes in the three integers in an RGB tuple, it should return a string with the equivalent hexadecimal notation, plus a hash sign (#) at the front. If it takes in a string in hex, it should return a tuple with the three integers corresponding to RGB.
